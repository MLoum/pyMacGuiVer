		int handle)
Standard movement function.  Acceleration and deceleration ramps are generated for the specified motion. In some cases when taking smaller steps the velocity parameter may be coerced to its maximum achievable value. The maximum and minimum velocities can be found using MCL_MDInformation. The maximum velocity differs depending on how many axes are commaned to move.

Parameters:
axis(1/2/3)	[IN]	Which axis to move.  (M1=1, M2=2, M3=3, M4=4, M5=5, M6=6) If using a Micro-Drive1,
			this argument is ignored.
velocity(1/2/3)	[IN]	Speed in mm/sec.
distance(1/2/3)	[IN]	Distance in mm to move the stage.  Positive distances move the stage toward its forward limit 				switch.  Negative distances move it toward its reverse limit switch.  A value of 0.0 will result in 				the axis not moving.
rounding(1/2/3)	[IN]	Determines how to round the distance parameter:
				0 - Nearest microstep.
				1 - Nearest full step.
				2 - Nearest half step.
handle		[IN]	Specifies which Micro-Drive to communicate with.

Return Value:
Returns MCL_SUCCESS or the appropriate error code.

Notes:
Care should be taken not to access the Micro-Drive while the microstage is moving for any reason other than stopping it. Doing so will adversely affect the internal timers of the Micro-Drive which generate the required step pulses for the specified movement.
